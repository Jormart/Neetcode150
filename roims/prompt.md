# 🚀 Project: Smart Expense Tracker – Microservices-Based

> **Enterprise-Grade Tech Stack**  
> This is an excellent and very enterprise-level tech stack — combining Spring Boot microservices with Spring Cloud, Kafka, CI/CD, and GCP deployment will not only boost your resume but also make you job-ready for real-world backend positions.

---

## 🎯 Project Description

Build a microservices-based expense tracking system where users can:

- ✅ Register/login (`auth` microservice)
- ✅ Add daily expenses and categorize them (`expense` microservice)
- ✅ View monthly reports and budget summaries (`reporting` microservice)
- ✅ Receive real-time notifications (via Kafka)

## 🧱 Microservices Architecture

| Service              | Description                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Auth Service**      | Handles JWT authentication and user registration                   |
| **Expense Service**   | Manages CRUD operations for expenses                                |
| **Reporting Service** | Aggregates data and generates reports                               |
| **Notification Service** | Listens to Kafka for updates and sends email/SMS (mocked)        |
| **Config Server**     | Centralized config management                                       |
| **Eureka Server**     | Service registry for discovery                                      |
| **API Gateway**       | Entry point that routes to the appropriate services                 |

## 🛠️ Tech Breakdown Per Requirement

- ✅ **Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate**  
  - Used in each microservice for REST APIs and database access.  
  - Each service has its own isolated PostgreSQL or MySQL database (or H2 for dev).

- ✅ **Spring Security**  
  - JWT-based authentication in the Auth Service.  
  - Gateway filters requests and forwards JWTs to downstream services.

- ✅ **Spring Cloud (Eureka, Config, Gateway)**  
  - Centralized configuration via Git repo (used by all microservices).  
  - Eureka service discovery.  
  - API Gateway handles routing and auth filtering.

- ✅ **Kafka**  
  - Example: when a user adds a large expense, the Expense Service pushes an event to Kafka.  
  - Notification Service consumes the event and sends a mock email/alert.

- ✅ **Jenkins**  
  - Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD.  
  - Build, test (JUnit/Mockito), Dockerize, and deploy to GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine).

- ✅ **Docker + Kubernetes**  
  - Each service has its own Dockerfile and k8s manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps).  
  - Helm (optional) for templating.  
  - Use GCP’s Artifact Registry and GKE for container orchestration.

- ✅ **OpenAPI / Swagger**  
  - Auto-generate Swagger docs for each microservice (with `springdoc-openapi` or `swagger-ui`).

- ✅ **JUnit/Mockito**  
  - Unit and integration tests for each service.  
  - Mock Kafka and REST interactions where needed.

## 🔁 Event Flow (Example)

1. User logs in via `Auth` → Gets JWT.  
2. API Gateway forwards request to `Expense Service` → Adds expense.  
3. `Expense Service` publishes to Kafka → `ExpenseAdded`.  
4. `Notification Service` listens and sends an alert  
   _e.g., “You spent 500 USD on Electronics”_.  
5. `Reporting Service` aggregates expense data over time.

---

## 🌐 Deployment to GCP

- Use **GKE** for deploying microservices.  
- Use **Jenkins** to push Docker images to Google Artifact Registry.  
- Secrets managed via **GCP Secret Manager** or **Kubernetes secrets**.  
- **GCP Load Balancer** fronts the API Gateway.  
- Optional: use **Cloud SQL** for managed databases.

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests**:  
  - With JUnit 5 + Mockito for service and controller layers.
  
- **Integration Tests**:  
  - Use `@SpringBootTest` with embedded DB and Kafka (e.g., [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)).

- **Contract Testing**:  
  - Optional, can be added using tools like [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/).
