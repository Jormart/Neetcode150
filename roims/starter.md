## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 🔹 Phase 1: Project Initialization

1. **Initialize GitHub Repository**

   * Create a new repository named `smart-expense-tracker`.
   * Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up Base Project**

   * Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate base projects for each microservice:

     * Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, Spring Security, Spring Cloud Config Client, Spring Cloud Discovery Client, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring for Apache Kafka, Spring Boot Actuator.
   * Import the generated projects into your IDE.

3. **Define Common Configuration**

   * Create a `config-server` project to serve centralized configurations.
   * Store configuration files in a Git repository or local file system.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Core Microservices Development

4. **Auth Service**

   * Implement user registration and login functionalities.
   * Use JWT for authentication and authorization.
   * Secure endpoints using Spring Security.

5. **Expense Service**

   * Implement CRUD operations for expenses.
   * Categorize expenses and store them in a PostgreSQL database.
   * Publish events to Kafka on significant actions (e.g., large expenses).

6. **Reporting Service**

   * Aggregate expense data to generate monthly reports and budget summaries.
   * Expose REST endpoints to fetch reports.

7. **Notification Service**

   * Consume events from Kafka.
   * Send notifications via email/SMS (mocked for now).

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Infrastructure and CI/CD

8. **Dockerize Microservices**

   * Create `Dockerfile` for each microservice.
   * Build Docker images and test them locally.

9. **Set Up Kubernetes Manifests**

   * Define Kubernetes manifests for each microservice:

     * Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets.
   * Use Helm charts for templating (optional).

10. **Configure Jenkins Pipeline**

    * Set up a Jenkins pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`) for CI/CD:

      * Build Docker images.
      * Push images to a container registry.
      * Deploy to Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Service Discovery and API Gateway

11. **Eureka Server**

    * Set up a Eureka server for service discovery.
    * Register each microservice with Eureka.

12. **API Gateway**

    * Implement an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway.
    * Route requests to appropriate microservices.
    * Apply security filters to validate JWT tokens.

---

### 🔹 Phase 5: Messaging and Notifications

13. **Kafka Integration**

    * Set up Kafka broker (locally or using a managed service).
    * Configure microservices to produce and consume messages.

14. **Notification Service**

    * Implement logic to send notifications based on events.
    * Mock email/SMS sending for now.

---

### 🔹 Phase 6: Testing and Monitoring

15. **Unit and Integration Tests**

    * Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
    * Write integration tests using Spring Boot Test and TestContainers.

16. **Monitoring and Observability**

    * Integrate Spring Boot Actuator for health checks and metrics.
    * Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
    * Implement centralized logging using ELK stack or similar.

---

### 🔹 Phase 7: Deployment to GCP

17. **Set Up GKE Cluster**

    * Create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.
    * Configure `kubectl` to interact with the cluster.

18. **Deploy Microservices**

    * Deploy microservices to GKE using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.

19. **Configure Load Balancer**

    * Set up a GCP Load Balancer to route traffic to the API Gateway.

20. **Manage Secrets**

    * Use GCP Secret Manager or Kubernetes secrets to manage sensitive data.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests**: Use JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit testing.
* **Integration Tests**: Use Spring Boot Test with embedded databases and Kafka.
* **Contract Tests**: Use tools like Pact for contract testing between services.
